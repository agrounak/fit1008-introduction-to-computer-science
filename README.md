FIT1008 Introduction to Computer Science notes, batch of Semester 1, 2019.

## Notes
Some notes are provided by Monash while the [source code](source_code) is written and compiled by me as a reference over what is being taught during the entire semester. It provides a guideline to me as to recall the basics of computer science. *Do take note of any inaccuracies made by me.* 

## Review over FIT1008
This unit is like an "entry point" into the field of computer science. Computer science itself focuses mainly on algorithms and data structures. This unit gives you the tastes of what algorithms and data structures is all about. Assignments and tutorials are simple, it just requires a little algorithmic and mathematical thinking. Following all tutorials and labs will not have issues of getting full marks over assignment problems. Lectures generally do not help a lot because algorithms and data structures are always best understood through self-coding rather than listening. Learning the algorithm and complexity then followed by "code by yourself" helps a lot on understanding the logic behind the algorithm, instead of reading the code from the lecture slides, which will not train algorithmic thinking. Working on assignments early is a plus. 

Overall Review: 8/10<br>Final Grade: HD
